#Carloan
The requisites are explained [here](https://github.com/Spronghi/software-engineering/blob/master/carloan/doc/CasoStudio.pdf) in italian. Carloan has an avaible [requirements analysis](https://github.com/Spronghi/software-engineering/blob/master/carloan/doc/Analisi_dei_Requisiti.pdf) and [project](https://github.com/Spronghi/software-engineering/blob/master/carloan/doc/Progettazione.pdf) documentation that explains everything you need to know. There is also a [kiuwan](https://github.com/Spronghi/software-engineering/blob/master/carloan/doc/kiuwan.pdf) evaluation
I'm using JavaFX 8 for spring and MySQL for database.

I hope to help someone in something.
