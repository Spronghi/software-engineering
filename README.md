# Software Engineering project
The repository contains two projects for software-engineering exam. 

## Carloan
The requisites are explained [here](https://github.com/Spronghi/software-engineering/blob/master/doc/CasoStudio.pdf) in italian. I'm using JavaFX 8 for spring and MySQL for database. The project is a standalone software for a car hire agency.
I hope to help someone.
